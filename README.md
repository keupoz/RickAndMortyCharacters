# Rick and Morty Characters

This project was created as a test task for a job at Elfsight. It uses [Rick and Morty API](https://rickandmortyapi.com/documentation/#introduction) as the backend.

## The task

Using [Rick and Morty API](https://rickandmortyapi.com/) implement a web app with the following functions:

- The user can conveniently view all the characters and the information about them (name, status, gender) provided by the API.
- Characters can be filtered by name, status, species, type and gender.
- All the filters can be applied all at once.
- The user can open a modal popup with full information about the character.

### Techical requirements

- The app is written using React and the [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) library for styling the components.
- The app works in modern browsers (last versions of Chrome and Safari), so using latest technologies and design patterns is welcome.
- Do not use third-party libraries with pre-made components.
- The app should look equally consistent on desktop and mobile devices.

## Used libraries

- [Rick and Morty API](https://rickandmortyapi.com/)
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/)
- [React Query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest)

## Running the app

The app is deployed at https://keupoz.ru/RickAndMortyCharacters but you can easily run it locally:

- Clone the repo and cd into the folder
- Run `npm install`
- Run `npm run dev`

It should start Vite dev server and make the app available at http://localhost:5173/
